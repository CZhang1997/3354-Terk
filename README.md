Introduction
Planning a trip can be straining and requires a lot of research and information about the locations. 
There are many applications that provide easy access to those information. 
However, the problem is that several of these applications need to be downloaded to access its certain features. 
Trek is an app that accumulates the basic as well as extensive travel planning features
in order to accommodate the customers by preventing them from downloading multiple apps to plan their travels. 

Objectives
1. Currency Converter
2. Calculate the sale tax based on what state you are located.
3. Friendly suggestions on how much the user should pay based on what they purchase. 
4. Digital map that calculates the time if the user wants to visit multiple areas.
5. Weather information based on GPS location.
6. Scheduler that will pull up recommendations within certain parameters of the area you are located and plan the path of travel for you.  
7. Locate and dial closest emergency services, based on GPS location.

Motivation
Many of us have relatives that encounter issues when they come to visit us,
but due to the unfamiliar systems that we have in place in the United States. 
One of the many issues foreigners encounter while visiting the United States is our taxing system, 
because in most our relativeâ€™s countries the tax is already included in the sale price 
unlike our added federal tax and varied state taxes which we seek to solve in our software system. 
This software system we are seeking to develop would solve many of 
the issues our family members encounter not only in our strange financial system 
but to also look deeper to all of the other necessities they might have while visiting us. 
Furthermore, our goal is exceeded the essential needs of foreigners visiting the United States, 
and to give them additional functionalities such as a scheduler and tip calculator to make their stay an enjoyable one.
